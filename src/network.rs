//! An abstraction layer for networking.
//!
//! The [`Network`] trait provides a common interface for networking operations.
//! When implementing [`Network`], the implementor determines the types:
//! - [`Network::Send`]: The type of messages to be sent.
//! - [`Network::Recv`]: The type of messages to be received.
//!
//! Specific implementations for different underlying network stacks are provided:
//! - [`UdpNetwork`] abstracts a simple UDP socket
//! - [`TcpNetwork`] handles TCP connections under the hood
//! - [`SimulatedNetwork`] provides a simulated network for local testing
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! use alpenglow::network::{Network, localhost_ip_sockaddr};
//!
//! async fn send_ping_receive_pong(network: impl Network<Send = String, Recv = String>) {
//!     let msg = "ping".to_string();
//!     network.send(&msg, localhost_ip_sockaddr(1337)).await.unwrap();
//!     let received = network.receive().await.unwrap();
//!     assert_eq!(&received, "pong");
//! }
//! ```
