//! Simulations for Ryse, the MCP proposal.
//!
//! Ryse is one instantiation of a multiple-concurrent proposers (MCP) consensus protocol.
//! As such, it provides the following economic properties:
//! - Selective-censorship resistance:
//!   A malicious consensus leader can not unilaterally exclude an honest proposer's proposal.
//! - Weak hiding:
//!   A malicious proposer cannot condition the contents of their block on the contents of another.
//!
//! Compared to Pyjama, Ryse aims to be a simple modification of Alpenglow.
//! That is, it is not a general gadget that can be combined with any consensus protocol.
//! Instead, it specifically modifies Alpenglow's Rotor block dissemination protocol.
//! In Ryse, each relay would release shreds from all leaders simultaneously.
