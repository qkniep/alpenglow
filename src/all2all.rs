//! Direct all-to-all broadcast protocols.
//!
//! The [`All2All`] trait gives a simple interface for broadcasting messages.
//! It does not impose restrictions on the guarantees that should be provided.
//! However, each implementor should clearly document which guarantees it provides.
//!
//! This module provides two implementations of the [`All2All`] trait:
//! - [`TrivialAll2All`] implements a simple best-effort all-to-all broadcast protocol.
//! - [`RobustAll2All`] is a more robust implementation, handling retransmits.
//!
//! The exact guarantees, however, also depend on the underlying [`Network`],
//! since both implementations are generic over the [`Network`] trait.
//! For example, [`TrivialAll2All`] over a TCP-based network might still give
//! strong reliability guarantess.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use alpenglow::network::{NetworkMessage};
//! use alpenglow::all2all::All2All;
//!
//! async fn broadcast_all(msgs: &[NetworkMessage], all2all: impl All2All) -> Result<(), NetworkSendError> {
//!     for msg in msgs {
//!         all2all.broadcast(msg).await?;
//!     }
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! [`Network`]: crate::network::Network
