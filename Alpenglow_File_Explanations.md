# Alpenglow Project: In-Depth File Explanations

This document provides a detailed explanation of every file in the Alpenglow project, based on source code analysis, command outputs, and functionality. It covers what each file does, why it exists, and key components. The project is a Rust implementation of the Alpenglow consensus protocol for distributed systems.

## Project Structure Overview

Alpenglow is organized as a Cargo workspace with:
- Main library in `src/`
- Binaries in `src/bin/`
- Tests in `tests/`
- Benchmarks in `benches/`
- Data files in `data/`
- Scripts in root

## Root Directory Files

### Cargo.toml
**What it does**: Defines the Rust package metadata, dependencies, and build configuration.
**Why it exists**: Cargo uses this to manage the project—compiling, dependencies, features.
**Key sections**:
- `[package]`: Name, version, authors, description (Alpenglow consensus protocol).
- `[dependencies]`: 40+ crates for crypto (blst for BLS sigs), networking (tokio), serialization (serde), logging (logforth), erasure coding (reed-solomon-simd), etc.
- `[bin]`: Defines binaries like `alpenglow`, `simulations`.
- `[workspace]`: No workspace here; single package.
**Output from `cargo --version`**: cargo 1.88.0 (confirms Rust toolchain).
