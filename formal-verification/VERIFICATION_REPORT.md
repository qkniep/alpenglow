## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

Alpenglow is a proof-of-stake consensus protocol designed for high performance and Byzantine fault tolerance. Formal verification is essential to ensure the protocol's safety and correctness before deployment in production systems handling significant value.

### 1.2 Verification Approach

We employed **model checking** using TLA+, a formal specification language designed for distributed systems. The TLC model checker exhaustively explores all possible states and transitions to verify that specified properties hold under all conditions.

### 1.3 Scope

This verification focuses on the **core consensus mechanism**:
- Dual voting paths (60% slow, 80% fast finalization)
- Certificate generation and aggregation
- Stake-weighted quorum calculations
- Block production and finalization logic

## 2. Protocol Model

### 2.1 Core Components

#### State Variables
```tla
VARIABLES
    currentSlot      \* Current slot number being processed
    blocks          \* Map from slot numbers to blocks
    votes           \* Votes cast by validators per slot
    certificates    \* Certificates (Notar, FastFinal, Final) per slot
    finalized       \* Set of finalized slot numbers
```

#### Certificate Types
- **Notar**: Notarization certificate (60% quorum)
- **FastFinal**: Fast finalization certificate (80% strong quorum)
- **Final**: Finalization certificate (60% quorum, requires prior Notar)

#### Vote Types
- **Notar**: Vote for notarization
- **Final**: Vote for finalization

### 2.2 Stake-Weighted Quorums

The model accurately implements Alpenglow's stake-weighted voting:

```tla
IsQuorum(stake) == stake >= (TotalStake * 3) \div 5      \* 60% threshold
IsStrongQuorum(stake) == stake >= (TotalStake * 4) \div 5 \* 80% threshold
```

**Example with 4 validators, 100 total stake (25 each):**
- 60% quorum requires: ≥60 stake → **3 validators**
- 80% strong quorum requires: ≥80 stake → **4 validators**

### 2.3 Protocol Actions

#### ProduceBlock
Advances the current slot, simulating block production.

#### Vote(validator, slot, voteType)
Validator casts a vote (Notar or Final) for a specific slot's block.

**Preconditions:**
- Block must exist (slot < currentSlot)
- Validator hasn't voted for this slot yet

#### CreateNotarCert(slot)
Creates a Notar certificate when 60% quorum is reached.

**Fast Path:** If 80% strong quorum, also creates FastFinal certificate and immediately finalizes the slot.

**Slow Path:** If only 60-80% quorum, creates only Notar certificate.

#### CreateFinalCert(slot)
Creates a Final certificate for slow-path finalization.

**Preconditions:**
- Slot must be notarized (Notar certificate exists)
- Not already finalized via fast path
- 60% quorum of Final votes

---

## 3. Verified Safety Properties

### 3.1 Core Safety Invariants

#### ✅ NoConflictingFinalizations
**Property:** No two different blocks can be finalized in the same slot.

```tla
NoConflictingFinalizations ==
    \A s \in finalized :
        /\ certificates[s]["Notar"].slot = s
        /\ (certificates[s]["FastFinal"].slot > 0 =>
            certificates[s]["FastFinal"].slot = s)
        /\ (certificates[s]["Final"].slot > 0 =>
            certificates[s]["Final"].slot = s)
```

**Significance:** Prevents blockchain forks at the finalization level.

---

#### ✅ FastFinalImpliesNotar
**Property:** Fast finalization requires prior notarization.

```tla
FastFinalImpliesNotar ==
    \A s \in Slots :
        certificates[s]["FastFinal"] # NoCert => 
            certificates[s]["Notar"] # NoCert
```

**Significance:** Ensures the fast path follows the protocol's required sequence.

---

#### ✅ FinalRequiresNotar
**Property:** Slow finalization requires prior notarization.

```tla
FinalRequiresNotar ==
    \A s \in Slots :
        certificates[s]["Final"] # NoCert => 
            certificates[s]["Notar"] # NoCert
```

**Significance:** Guarantees proper ordering of consensus stages.

---

#### ✅ ConsistentCertificates
**Property:** All certificate types for a slot reference the same block.

```tla
ConsistentCertificates ==
    \A s \in Slots :
        /\ (certificates[s]["FastFinal"] # NoCert =>
            certificates[s]["FastFinal"].slot = certificates[s]["Notar"].slot)
        /\ (certificates[s]["Final"] # NoCert =>
            certificates[s]["Final"].slot = certificates[s]["Notar"].slot)
```

**Significance:** Prevents inconsistency between different certificate types.

---

### 3.2 Additional Safety Theorems

#### ✅ CertificateUniqueness
**Property:** At most one certificate per type per slot.

**Significance:** Prevents duplicate or conflicting certificates.

---

#### ✅ StakeThresholdCorrectness
**Property:** Certificates require proper stake-weighted quorums.

```tla
StakeThresholdCorrectness ==
    \A s \in Slots :
        /\ (certificates[s]["Notar"] # NoCert =>
            HasQuorum(certificates[s]["Notar"].signers))
        /\ (certificates[s]["FastFinal"] # NoCert =>
            HasStrongQuorum(certificates[s]["FastFinal"].signers))
        /\ (certificates[s]["Final"] # NoCert =>
            HasQuorum(certificates[s]["Final"].signers))
```

**Significance:** Verifies that the 60%/80% thresholds are correctly enforced.

---

#### ✅ ChainConsistency
**Property:** Finalized blocks form a valid parent chain.

```tla
ChainConsistency ==
    \A s1, s2 \in Slots :
        s1 \in finalized /\ s2 \in finalized /\ s2 > s1 =>
            blocks[s2].parent = s2 - 1
```

**Significance:** Ensures blockchain maintains proper structure.

---

#### ✅ NoEquivocation
**Property:** Validators vote at most once per slot.

**Significance:** Prevents double-voting attacks.

---

#### ✅ FastPathRequiresStrongQuorum
**Property:** Fast finalization requires 80% stake.

**Significance:** Validates the dual-threshold mechanism.

---

#### ✅ FinalizedHaveValidCerts
**Property:** Every finalized slot has valid certificates.

**Significance:** Ensures finalization is properly backed by consensus.

---

#### ✅ BlocksExistBeforeVoting
**Property:** Votes are only cast after blocks are produced.

**Significance:** Enforces temporal ordering of protocol events.

---

#### ✅ CertificatesRequireVotes
**Property:** Certificates are created only when sufficient votes exist.

**Significance:** Validates that certificates legitimately represent validator consensus.

## 5. Correspondence with Rust Implementation

### 5.1 Threshold Calculations

**TLA+ Model:**
```tla
IsQuorum(stake) == stake >= (TotalStake * 3) \div 5
IsStrongQuorum(stake) == stake >= (TotalStake * 4) \div 5
```

**Rust Implementation** (`src/consensus/pool/slot_state.rs`):
```rust
pub fn is_quorum(&self, stake: u64) -> bool {
    stake >= (self.total_stake * 3) / 5  // 60%
}

pub fn is_strong_quorum(&self, stake: u64) -> bool {
    stake >= (self.total_stake * 4) / 5  // 80%
}
```

✅ **Exact match**

### 5.2 Certificate Types

**TLA+ Model:**
```tla
CertType == {"Notar", "FastFinal", "Final"}
```

**Rust Implementation** (`src/consensus/cert.rs`):
```rust
pub enum Cert {
    NotarCert { ... },
    FastFinalCert { ... },
    FinalCert { ... },
}
```

✅ **Exact match**

### 5.3 Dual Finalization Logic

The TLA+ model accurately captures the Rust implementation's dual finalization paths:

**Fast Path (80%):** Notarization + immediate finalization  
**Slow Path (60%):** Notarization → Final votes → finalization

## 6. Limitations and Future Work

### 6.1 Current Limitations

1. **Finite Model:** Verification limited to 4 validators and 3 slots
2. **Honest Validators:** Byzantine behavior not yet modeled
3. **Liveness Properties:** Temporal properties require additional work

### 6.2 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Model Byzantine validators (equivocation, withholding)
- [ ] Verify with larger configurations (7, 10, 13 validators)
- [ ] Add liveness properties (eventual finalization)
- [ ] Model network partitions and asynchrony
