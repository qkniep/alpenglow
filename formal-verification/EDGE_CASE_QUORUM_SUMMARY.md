## 2. Technical Implementation

### Configuration Details

**File:** `formal-verification/MC_edge_quorum_ok.cfg`

```tla
\* Edge Case Configuration: Quorum Threshold Boundary Test
\* Tests the consensus protocol with a minimal validator set (4 validators)
\* using uniform stake distribution (25% each). This exercises quorum
\* formation at critical thresholds (60% for quorum, 80% for strong quorum).
\* Quick execution (~2s, ~8.9K states) makes it suitable for CI smoke testing.

SPECIFICATION Spec
CONSTANTS
  Validators = {"v1", "v2", "v3", "v4"}
  MaxSlot = 2
  TotalStake = 100
INVARIANTS
  StakeThresholdCorrectness
  NoConflictingFinalizations
  ConsistentCertificates
  CertificateUniqueness
  ChainConsistency
  NoEquivocation
  FastPathRequiresStrongQuorum
  FinalizedHaveValidCerts
```

### Key Parameters

- **Validators:** 4 validators (v1, v2, v3, v4)
- **Stake Distribution:** Uniform (25% each = 25 stake units per validator)
- **Total Stake:** 100 units
- **MaxSlot:** 2 (small for quick execution)
- **Quorum Threshold:** 60% (60 stake units, requires 3/4 validators)
- **Strong Quorum:** 80% (80 stake units, requires 4/4 validators)

### Invariants Validated

8 core safety properties checked:
1. **StakeThresholdCorrectness** - Certificates require proper quorum
2. **NoConflictingFinalizations** - No two different blocks finalized at same slot
3. **ConsistentCertificates** - Certificate types follow protocol rules
4. **CertificateUniqueness** - At most one certificate per slot per type
5. **ChainConsistency** - Finalized blocks form a consistent chain
6. **NoEquivocation** - Validators don't vote for conflicting blocks
7. **FastPathRequiresStrongQuorum** - FastFinal requires 80% stake
8. **FinalizedHaveValidCerts** - All finalized slots have valid certificates

## 4. Debugging Journey & Root Cause

### Problem Encountered

TLC consistently failed with:
```
Error: The constant parameter MaxSlot is not assigned
```

Despite `MaxSlot = 2` being present in the config file.

### Root Cause Identified

**UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark)** at the start of the file:

```
00000000   EF BB BF 53 50 45 43 49 46 49 43 41 54 49 4F 4E  ï»¿SPECIFICATION
           ^^^^^^^^ BOM
```

The BOM (`EF BB BF`) caused TLC's parser to fail silently when reading the config.

### Solution Applied

1. **Rewrote file with ASCII encoding** (no BOM):
   ```powershell
   Out-File -Encoding ASCII -NoNewline
   ```

2. **Verified BOM removal**:
   ```
   00000000   53 50 45 43 49 46 49 43 41 54 49 4F 4E 20 53 70  SPECIFICATION Sp
              ^^ No BOM - starts directly with 'S' (0x53)
   ```

3. **Fixed invalid invariants** - Removed `QuorumIntersection` and `ValidCertificateStake` which don't exist in Alpenglow.tla

4. **Result:** TLC parsed successfully and completed verification in 2 seconds.

### Lessons Learned

- ✅ **Always use ASCII encoding for TLC config files** (no UTF-8 BOM)
- ✅ **Validate invariants exist in the spec** before adding to config
- ✅ **Use hex inspection** to debug parsing failures
- ✅ **Test against baseline configs** (MC.cfg) to isolate issues
- ✅ **PowerShell here-strings with ASCII encoding** are reliable for config generation

## 5. CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow Updates

**File:** `.github/workflows/verify.yml`

Added **Job 2: Edge Case Smoke Tests** between quick-verification and rotor-verification:

```yaml
edge-case-smoke-tests:
  name: Edge Case Smoke Tests
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  timeout-minutes: 5
  
  steps:
    - name: Run Quorum Edge Case Test
      run: |
        java -XX:+UseParallelGC -Xmx2g -jar /tmp/tla2tools.jar \
          -deadlock -workers auto \
          -config MC_edge_quorum_ok.cfg Alpenglow.tla 2>&1 | \
          tee mc_edge_quorum_ok.log
    
    - name: Check edge case results
      run: |
        if grep -q "No error has been found" mc_edge_quorum_ok.log; then
          echo "✅ Quorum edge case verification passed"
        else
          echo "❌ Edge case verification found errors!"
          exit 1
        fi
```

### CI Pipeline Structure (Updated)

1. **Job 1:** Quick Verification (Core Safety) - MC.cfg
2. **Job 2:** Edge Case Smoke Tests - **MC_edge_quorum_ok.cfg** ← NEW
3. **Job 3:** Rotor Propagation Verification
4. **Job 4:** Byzantine Fault Tolerance
5. **Job 5:** Full Verification Suite (manual/PR)
6. **Job 6:** Verification Summary Report (depends on Jobs 1, 2, 3)

### Benefits

- ✅ **Catches config regressions** - Any future changes breaking edge-case configs will fail CI
- ✅ **Fast feedback** - 5-minute timeout, typically completes in 2-3 seconds
- ✅ **Boundary testing** - Validates quorum thresholds in CI on every push
- ✅ **Artifact preservation** - Logs uploaded for debugging if failures occur

## 6. Git Commits

### Commit 1: Feature Implementation
```
commit 5dc0012
feat(formal-verification): Add quorum edge-case config and CI smoke test

- Added MC_edge_quorum_ok.cfg: TLC config for testing quorum threshold boundaries
  * Uses 4 validators with uniform stake distribution (25% each)
  * Tests with MaxSlot=2 for quick execution (~2s, 8.9K distinct states)
  * Validates core safety invariants: StakeThresholdCorrectness, NoConflictingFinalizations, etc.
  * Fixed BOM encoding issue that was preventing TLC parsing

- Enhanced CI pipeline (.github/workflows/verify.yml):
  * Added Job 2: Edge case smoke tests for quick boundary condition validation
  * Runs MC_edge_quorum_ok.cfg on every push to catch config regressions
  * Updated job numbering (Byzantine -> Job 4, Full -> Job 5, Report -> Job 6)
  * Integrated edge-case-smoke-tests into report dependencies
```

### Commit 2: Documentation
```
commit 08bbe3f
docs(formal-verification): Add header documentation to MC_edge_quorum_ok.cfg

- Explains the purpose: quorum threshold boundary testing
- Documents the configuration: 4 validators, uniform 25% stakes
- Notes performance: ~2s execution, ~8.9K states
- Clarifies use case: CI smoke testing for edge cases
```

## 7. Next Steps & Future Work

### Immediate Actions (Optional)
- [ ] Test CI pipeline by pushing changes and monitoring GitHub Actions
- [ ] Verify edge-case smoke test completes successfully in CI
- [ ] Clean up temporary files (*.log, *_tmp.cfg, *.clean)

### Future Enhancements (Recommended)
1. **Non-uniform stake distribution**
   - Modify Alpenglow.tla to support a `Stakes` constant (currently assumes uniform)
   - Create MC_edge_nonuniform_stakes.cfg with [34%, 33%, 33%, 0%] distribution
   - Test exact 67% threshold boundary (v1+v2 = 67%, v1+v3 = 67%)

2. **Additional edge cases**
   - MC_edge_byzantine_minimal.cfg - Minimal Byzantine tolerance (3 validators, 1 faulty)
   - MC_edge_single_validator.cfg - Degenerate case (1 validator = 100% stake)
   - MC_edge_large_maxslot.cfg - Deeper state exploration (MaxSlot=5-10)

3. **Liveness properties**
   - Add temporal properties testing eventual finalization
   - Verify AllSlotsFinalized under fairness assumptions

4. **Performance benchmarking**
   - Track state space growth as MaxSlot increases
   - Document state explosion thresholds for capacity planning
