## 🎯 Verification Options

### 1. Core Safety Properties ⚡ Fast (~2 min)
Verifies **12 safety invariants**:
- NoConflictingFinalizations
- FastFinalImpliesNotar
- FinalRequiresNotar
- And 9 more...

**What it proves:** No two blocks can be finalized at the same slot, certificates are valid, dual paths work correctly.

---

### 2. Byzantine Adversary Model 🛡️ (~5-10 min)
Verifies **16 invariants** with malicious validators:
- All 12 safety properties
- ByzantineStakeBounded (≤33%)
- HonestMajority (≥67%)
- SafetyDespiteEquivocation
- EquivocationsOnlyByzantine

**What it proves:** Safety holds even when Byzantine validators actively try to break consensus through equivocation and vote withholding.

**State space:** 10M+ states explored!

---

### 3. Liveness Properties ⏱️ (~2-5 min)
Verifies **4 temporal properties**:
- EventualMaxSlot
- EventuallySomeFinalization
- Progress
- NoDeadlock

**What it proves:** Protocol always makes progress, blocks eventually get finalized, no deadlocks occur.

---

### 4. Run All 🔥 (~10-15 min)
Runs all three verifications sequentially. Perfect for comprehensive verification!

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites

### Required:
1. **Java 8+** - Download from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
2. **tla2tools.jar** - Download from [TLA+ Releases](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/releases/latest/download/tla2tools.jar)
   - Place in `alpenglow/` root directory

### Optional (for CLI):
- **Python 3.6+** (for `verify.py`)
- **PowerShell 5.1+** (for `verify.ps1`, pre-installed on Windows)

The CLI tools automatically check prerequisites and guide you!

---

## 📊 Understanding Results

### ✅ SUCCESS
```
✅ MODEL CHECKING COMPLETED - NO ERRORS FOUND!
✅ Safety: PASSED
✅ Byzantine: PASSED
✅ Liveness: PASSED
```
**Meaning:** All properties mathematically proven correct across millions of states!

### ❌ FAILURE (if found)
```
❌ INVARIANT VIOLATED: NoConflictingFinalizations
```
**Meaning:** TLC found a counter-example showing how the property can be violated. Review the trace to understand the issue.

## 🎨 CLI Features

### Color-Coded Output
- 🟢 **Green** = Success / Passed
- 🔵 **Blue** = Information
- 🟡 **Yellow** = Warning / In Progress
- 🔴 **Red** = Error / Failed
- 🟣 **Cyan** = Progress Updates

### Real-Time Metrics
- **Generated:** Total states explored (including duplicates)
- **Distinct:** Unique states found
- **Queue:** States waiting to be explored
- **Depth:** Maximum path length from initial state

### Automatic Formatting
- Numbers formatted with commas: `6,229,333`
- Time estimates provided
- Clean, readable output

---

## 💡 Tips

### For Fastest Verification
Start with **Option 1 (Core Safety)** - proves the fundamental properties in ~2 minutes.

### For Comprehensive Proof
Run **Option 4 (All)** - complete mathematical proof of safety, Byzantine resilience, and liveness.

### For Debugging
If verification fails, the CLI shows which invariant was violated and TLC provides a counter-example trace.

## 🤝 Support

Having issues?

1. **Check Prerequisites:** CLI tool validates Java and tla2tools.jar
2. **Read Output:** Error messages guide you to the problem
3. **Review Docs:** `README.md` has troubleshooting section
4. **Raw TLC:** If CLI fails, run TLC directly (see `README.md`)

## 🎉 What This Proves

When all verifications pass, you have **mathematical proof** that:

✅ **Safety:** Alpenglow never finalizes conflicting blocks  
✅ **Byzantine Resilience:** Safety holds with malicious validators  
✅ **Liveness:** Protocol makes progress and finalizes blocks  
✅ **Dual Paths:** Both 60% slow and 80% fast paths work correctly  
✅ **Certificate Integrity:** All certificates properly validated  
✅ **Stake Thresholds:** Quorum calculations are correct  

**This is not testing - this is PROOF!** 🔬
