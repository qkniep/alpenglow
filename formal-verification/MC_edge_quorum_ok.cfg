\* Edge Case Configuration: Quorum Threshold Boundary Test
\* Tests the consensus protocol with a minimal validator set (4 validators)
\* using uniform stake distribution (25% each). This exercises quorum
\* formation at critical thresholds (60% for quorum, 80% for strong quorum).
\* Quick execution (~2s, ~8.9K states) makes it suitable for CI smoke testing.
